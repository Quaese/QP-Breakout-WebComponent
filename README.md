# `<qp-breakout>` — Breakout Game

A classic breakout/brick-breaker game as a Web Component, rendered on layered
HTML5 Canvases. A ball bounces off a player-controlled paddle, destroying bricks
on contact. The game features multiple levels with predefined and randomly
generated layouts, multi-hit bricks (silver 2 hits, gold 3 hits), an extra-life
bonus, and a parallax star/logo background. Game elements (ball, paddle, bricks)
can be rendered as sprite images or drawn programmatically.

## Usage

```html
<!-- Default: sprite images, German UI -->
<qp-breakout></qp-breakout>

<!-- Fixed width, English UI, programmatic drawing -->
<qp-breakout width="600" lang="en" use-images="false"></qp-breakout>
```

```html
<script type="module" src="/js/components-web/qp-breakout/qp-breakout.wc.js"></script>
```

## Attributes

**`width`** (number, optional)

- Canvas width in pixels. When omitted the component scales to its container
  using the `scale` factor. Canvas height is limited to 90% of the viewport height.

**`scale`** (number, default: `0.75`)

- Scale factor (0–1) relative to the container width.

**`lang`** (string, default: `"de"`)

- Language code for translations (`"de"` or `"en"`).

**`use-images`** (string, default: `true`)

- Render game elements as sprite images. Set to `"false"` to use programmatic
  canvas drawing.

## Game States

| State | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `init` | Initial state after component load, shows title screen |
| `waiting` | Ball rests on paddle, player can position before launch |
| `running` | Ball is in play, game loop active |
| `paused` | Game loop stopped, resumable via Space |
| `complete` | All bricks destroyed, shows level-complete screen |
| `stopped` | Game over, shows game-over screen with final score |

## Screens

Overlay layers toggled automatically by `_setState()`:

- **Init screen** — title "QP Breakout" with semi-transparent logo background
- **Start screen** — instructions before ball launch (Arrow keys, Space)
- **Pause screen** — shown during pause
- **Complete screen** — level complete with score, level, and remaining lives
- **Game-over screen** — final score and level reached

## Events

All events are `CustomEvent` with `bubbles: true` and `composed: true` (cross Shadow DOM).
Every event carries `detail: { lives, score, level }` unless noted otherwise.

**`qp-breakout.game-started`**

- Fired when a new game starts.
- `detail: { lives, score, level }`

**`qp-breakout.game-paused`**

- Fired when the game is paused.
- `detail: { lives, score, level }`

**`qp-breakout.game-resumed`**

- Fired when the game is resumed after pause.
- `detail: { lives, score, level }`

**`qp-breakout.game-level-up`**

- Fired when the player advances to the next level.
- `detail: { lives, score, level }`

**`qp-breakout.level-complete`**

- Fired when all bricks on the current level are destroyed.
- `detail: { lives, score, level }`

**`qp-breakout.game-extra-life`**

- Fired when an extra life is awarded (every 1,000 points).
- `detail: { lives, score, level }`

**`qp-breakout.game-life-lost`**

- Fired when the ball falls below the paddle.
- `detail: { lives }`
  - `lives` — remaining lives

**`qp-breakout.game-over`**

- Fired when all lives are lost or the player stops the game.
- `detail: { lives, score, level }`

```js
document.querySelector('qp-breakout').addEventListener('qp-breakout.game-over', (e) => {
  console.log(`Game over at level ${e.detail.level} with score ${e.detail.score}`);
});
```

## Game Flow

1. Component loads in **init** state showing the title screen.
   Player presses **Start** or **Space** to begin.
2. The ball rests on the centered paddle (**waiting**). The player can move
   the paddle with **Arrow keys** — the ball follows. Pressing **Space**
   launches the ball upward (**running**).
3. Bricks are destroyed on collision, awarding points based on type. Multi-hit
   bricks (silver, gold) require multiple hits and show reduced opacity as
   visual feedback.
4. Losing the ball costs a life. The paddle re-centers and the ball is placed
   on top again (**waiting**), ready for the next launch. Losing all lives
   triggers game-over (**stopped**).
5. Clearing all bricks shows the level-complete screen (**complete**).
   Pressing **Space** advances to the next level.
6. An extra life is awarded every `EXTRA_LIVE` (1,000) points.

## UI Sections

- **Scoreboard** — state indicator, remaining bricks, score, level, lives
- **Canvas** — 4 stacked HTML5 Canvases (background stars, logo watermark, bricks, game).
  All canvases share a single static `ResizeObserver` (Canvas class) and limit
  their height to 90% of the viewport height.
- **Screens** — overlay layers for init, waiting, paused, complete, and game-over states
- **Button bar** — Start, Pause, Stop
  - **Start** — starts a new game
  - **Pause** — pauses/resumes the running game; advances to next level on complete
  - **Stop** — stops the current game

## Lifecycle

**`connectedCallback`**

- Loads images (logo + game sprites when `use-images` is enabled), then renders the component.

**`disconnectedCallback`**

- Stops the game loop, removes event listeners, and destroys all canvases.

**`attributeChangedCallback`**

- Re-renders when `width`, `scale`, `lang`, or `use-images` changes.

## Translations

All visible text (screens, scoreboard, buttons) is resolved via `_dict()`
(Dictionary module) with a built-in `_defaultDict()` fallback (de/en).
